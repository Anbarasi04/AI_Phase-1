Sentiment analysis for marketing using BERT:
   Sentiment analysis, a powerful tool in the realm of data analytics, enables marketers to gain deep insights into customer opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed in textual data. The advent of advanced natural language processing (NLP) models, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), has revolutionized the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment analysis, providing marketers with unprecedented capabilities to comprehend and respond to consumer sentiments at scale.
   BERT is pre-trained on massive amounts of text data in an unsupervised manner. During pre-training, the model learns to predict missing words in sentences, considering the bidirectional context. After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or named entity recognition.
